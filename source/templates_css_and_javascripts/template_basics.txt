 TAL page templates
=======================

.. admonition:: Description

    Plone uses Zope Page Templates. This document contains references to
    this template language and generally available templates, macros and
    views you can use to build your Plone add-on product.

Introduction
=============

Plone uses `Zope Page Templates <http://docs.zope.org/zope2/zope2book/AppendixC.html>`_, 
consisting of the three related standards: Template Attribute Language
(TAL), TAL Expression Syntax (TALES), and Macro Expansion TAL (METAL).

A normal full Plone HTML page consists of:

* the *master template*, defining the overall layout of the page,
* *slots*, defined by the master template, and filled by the object being
  published,
* :doc:`Viewlet managers </views/viewlets>` containing :doc:`viewlets </views/viewlets>`

Templates can be associated with Python view classes (also known as new style, circa 2008) or
they can be standalone (old style, circa 2001).

.. note ::

        The rationale for moving away from standalone page templates is that
        the page template code becomes easily cluttered with inline Python
        code. This makes templates hard to customize or override.  New style
        templates provide better separation with view logic (Python code)
        and HTML generation (page template).

Overriding templates
======================

The recommended approach to customize .pt files for Plone 4 is to use a little helper
called *z3c.jbot*.

If you need to place your .pt in Plone to override Plone core or existing add-on functionality 

* You `roll-out your own add-on <https://github.com/miohtama/sane_plone_addon_template>`_
  where you can place your page templates on file system

* You use `z3c.bot <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/z3c.jbot/>`_ Plone helper add-on to override 
  page templates. This is provided in the add-on above, no separate set-up needed.

* `z3c.jbot`` can override page templates (.pt files) for views, viewlets, old style page templates
  and portlets. In fact it can override any .pt file in Plone source tree.

To override a template
-----------------------

`First Make sure you have your customization add-on in place which supports z3c.jbot <https://github.com/miohtama/sane_plone_addon_template>`_.
This has a templates folder where you can drop in your new .pt files.

Locate the template you need to override in Plone source tree. You can do this by searching ``eggs/``
folder of your Plone installation for .pt files. Usually this folder is (something)/buildout-cache/eggs.

Below is an example UNIX find command to find .pt files. You can also use Windows Explorer file search or similar tools::
	
	[~/code/buildout-cache/eggs]% find . -iname "*.pt"
	./archetypes.kss-1.4.3-py2.4.egg/archetypes/kss/browser/edit_field_wrapper.pt
	./archetypes.kss-1.4.3-py2.4.egg/archetypes/kss/browser/view_field_wrapper.pt
	./archetypes.kss-1.6.0-py2.6.egg/archetypes/kss/browser/edit_field_wrapper.pt
	./archetypes.kss-1.6.0-py2.6.egg/archetypes/kss/browser/view_field_wrapper.pt

.. note ::

	Your eggs/ folder may contain several versions of the same egg
	if you have re-run buildout or upgraded Plone. In this case the correct
	action is usually to pick up the latest version.

Get a copy of .pt file you are going to override.

Rename the file ot its so called canonical name. Exclude .egg folder anme from the filename. Then replace all slashes / with dot .::

	archetypes/kss/browser/edit_field_wrapper.pt

to::

	archetypes.kss.browser.edit_field_wrapper.pt

Drop the file in templates folder you have registered for ``z3c.jbot`` in your add-on.

Make your changes in .pt file.

If you run Plone in development mode and your add-on is installed for the site the changes are instant 
if the filename is correct when you hit refresh in your web browser.

Main template
=============

The master page template in Plone is called ``main_template.pt`` and it is
provided by the
`Products.CMFPlone package <http://svn.plone.org/svn/plone/Plone/trunk/Products/CMFPlone/skins/plone_templates/main_template.pt>`_.

This template provides the visual frame for Plone themes. The template is
an old-style page template living in ``plone_skins/plone_templates``.

Plone template element map
==========================

Plone 4 ships with the *Sunburst* theme. Its viewlets and viewlets managers
are described 
`here <http://plone.org/documentation/manual/theme-reference/elements/elementsindexsunburst4>`_. 

.. note ::

        Plone 3 viewlets differ.

Zope Page Templates
===================

Zope Page Templates, or ZPT for short, is an XML-based templating language,
consisting of the Template Attribute Language (TAL), TAL Expression Syntax
(TALES), and Macro Expansion TAL (METAL).

It operates using two XML namespaces (``tal:`` and ``metal:``) that can
occur either on attributes of elements in another namespace (e.g. you will
often have TAL attributes on HTML elements) or on elements (in which case
the element itself will be ignored, but all its attributes will be
recognized as TAL statements).

A statement in the ``tal:`` namespace will modify the element on which it
occurs and/or its child elements.

A statement in the ``metal::`` namespace defines how a template interacts
with other templates (defining or using macros and slots to be filled by
macros).

The value of an attribute in the ``tal:`` namespace is an expression. The 
format of this expression is defined by the TALES standard.


TAL
===

`TAL <http://wiki.zope.org/ZPT/TALSpecification14>`_ is the Template
Attribute Language used in Plone.

* `TAL Guide <http://www.owlfish.com/software/simpleTAL/tal-guide.html>`_


Escaped and unescaped content
=============================

By default, all TAL output is escaped for security reasons.

.. code-block:: python

	view.text = "<b>Test</b>"

.. code-block:: html

	<div tal:content="view/text" />

Will output escaped HTML source code::

	&lt;b&gt;Testlt;/b&gt;

Unescaped content can be outputted using the TALES ``structure`` keyword
in the expression for the ``tal:replace`` and ``tal:content`` statements:

.. code-block:: html

	<div tal:replace="structure view/text" />

Will output unescaped HTML source code::

	<b>Test</b>

METAL
======

The METAL (Macro Expansion TAL) standard provides macros and slots to the
template language.

Using METAL macros is no longer recommended, since they couple programming
logic too tightly with the template language.  You should use views instead.

Read more about them in the 
`TAL Guide <http://www.owlfish.com/software/simpleTAL/tal-guide.html>`_.

TALES expressions
======================

The value of TAL statements are defined by TALES expressions. A TALES
expression starts with the expression type. If no type is specified, the
default is assumed. Three types are standard:

* ``path:`` expressions (*default*),
* ``python:`` expressions,
* ``string:`` expressions.

They are generally usefull, and not limited to use in Page Templates. For example, they are widely used in various other parts of Plone:

* CSS, Javascript and KSS registries, to decide whether to include a
  particular file;
* Action conditions, to decide whether to show or hide action link;
* Workflow security guards, to decide whether to allow a workflow state
  transition
* etc.

Read more about expressions in `TAL Guide <http://www.owlfish.com/software/simpleTAL/tal-guide.html>`_.

See :doc:`Expressions chapter </functionality/expressions>` for more information.

Omitting tags
=================

Sometimes you need to create XML control structures which should not end up
to the output page.

You can use ``tal:omit-tag=""``

.. code-block:: xml

	<div tal:omit-tag="">
  		Only the content of the tag is rendered, not the DIV tag itself.
	</div>

Images
======

See :doc:`how to use images in templates </images/templates>`.

Overriding templates for exising Plone views
==============================================

#. New style templates can be overridden by overriding the view using the
   template.

#. Old stype templates can be overridden by register a new skins layer in
   ``plone_skins``.

View page template
------------------

* http://lionfacelemonface.wordpress.com/2009/03/02/i-used-macros-in-my-browser-views-and-saved-a-bunch-of-money-on-my-car-insurance/

Old style page template
-----------------------

* Create a new layer in ``portal_skins``

* Templates are resolved by their name, and a property on the
  ``portal_skins`` tool defines the order in which skin layers are 
  searched for the name (see the *Properties* tab on ``portal_skins``).

* You can reorder layers for the active theme so that your layer takes
  priority.

Portlet slots
=============

By default, Plone ``main_template`` has slots for left and right portlets.
If you have a view where you don't explicitly want to render portlets you
can do:

.. code-block:: html

    <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en"
            xmlns:tal="http://xml.zope.org/namespaces/tal"
            xmlns:metal="http://xml.zope.org/namespaces/metal"
            xmlns:i18n="http://xml.zope.org/namespaces/i18n"
            lang="en"
            metal:use-macro="here/main_template/macros/master"
            i18n:domain="plone">

            <head>
                <metal:block fill-slot="column_one_slot" />
                <metal:block fill-slot="column_two_slot" />
            </head>

This blanks out the ``column_one_slot`` and ``column_two_slot`` slots.

Head slots
================

You can easily include per-template CSS and Javscripts in ``<head>`` using
extra slots defined in Plone's ``main_template.pt``.

Note that these media files do not participate in 
:doc:`portal_css </templates_css_and_javascripts/css>` or
:doc:`portal_javascript </templates_css_and_javascripts/javascript>`
resource compression. 

Extra slots are

.. code-block:: xml

    <tal:comment replace="nothing"> A slot where you can insert elements in the header from a template </tal:comment>
    <metal:headslot define-slot="head_slot" />

    <tal:comment replace="nothing"> A slot where you can insert CSS in the header from a template </tal:comment>
    <metal:styleslot define-slot="style_slot" />

    <tal:comment replace="nothing"> This is deprecated, please use style_slot instead. </tal:comment>
    <metal:cssslot define-slot="css_slot" />

    <tal:comment replace="nothing"> A slot where you can insert javascript in the header from a template </tal:comment>
    <metal:javascriptslot define-slot="javascript_head_slot" />

Example use

.. code-block:: html

    <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en"
          lang="en"
          metal:use-macro="here/main_template/macros/master"
          i18n:domain="sits">

          <metal:slot fill-slot="css_slot">
              <style media="all" type="text/css">

                .schema-browser {
                        border-collapse: collapse;
                }

                .schema-browser td,
                .schema-browser th {
                        vertical-align: top;
                        border: 1px solid #aaa;
                        padding: 0.5em;
                        text-align: left;
                }

                .default {
                        color: green;
                }

                .mandatory {
                        color: red;
                }
              </style>
          </metal:slot>

    <body>
        <metal:main fill-slot="main">
            <p>
                Protocols marked with question marks can be required or not
                depending of the current state of the patient.  For example,
                priodisability field depends on other set fields of the
                patient.
            </p>
        ...


Edit frame
---------------

By default, Plone draws a green *edit* frame around the content if you can
edit it. You might want to disable this behavior for particular views.

Hiding the edit frame
---------------------------

If you'd like to hide the (green) editing frame, place the following code in
your Zope 2-style page template::

     <metal:block fill-slot="top_slot"
                tal:define="dummy python:request.set('disable_border',1)" />

Examples of this usage:

* Contact info page - http://svn.plone.org/svn/plone/CMFPlone/tags/3.1.4/skins/plone_templates/contact-info.cpt

* Recently modified page - http://svn.plone.org/svn/plone/CMFPlone/tags/3.1.4/skins/plone_templates/recently_modified.pt

Special style on individual pages
===================================

To override page layout partially for individual pages you can use marker
interfaces to register special overriding viewlets.
