Overview
========

If you want to work on the file system, here's the magic required to get
yourself set up with a skeleton set of files and code.

This section will talk you through the processes required to create your
own theme on the file system and to install this in your own Plone
site. 

The good news is that you don't have to write substantial amounts of
code yourself to create the framework for your own file system theme,
you can use a generator (Paster from ZopeSkel) to do this for you. This
will give you a directory containing a number of pre-prepared
directories and files, which you can augment or re-write with your own
customizations.

-  In `Practical 1: How to Create a Plone 3 Theme Product on the File
   System <http://plone.org/documentation/manual/theme-reference/tools/egg1/practical1>`_,
   you'll use the code generator to make your skeleton framework. This
   practical will also talk you through the files you've been given and
   what they do.
-  In `Practical 2: How to Install your Plone 3 Theme Using
   Buildout <http://plone.org/documentation/manual/theme-reference/tools/egg1/practical2>`_,
   you'll make this product available for your Plone site to install and
   use.
