Theming guide for Plone 3
==========================

Preface
-------------

This is a theming guide for Plone 3. The technologies here work
directly on Zope Page Templates (TAL) and viewlets.
On Plone 4.2+ versions of Plone the suggested approach for theming your site
is `plone.app.theming <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/plone.app.theming>`_
where you can create your theme through-the-web and with less
needed low level programming information.

Even if not recommended the techniques described are
still useful and might be needed with new versions of Plone.
Please consult
`stackoverflow.com (plone tag) <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/plone>`_ or
`plone-users mailing list <http://plone.org/support/forums/general>`_
when in confusion.
