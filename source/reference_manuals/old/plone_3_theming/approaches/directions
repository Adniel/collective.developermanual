Future Directions
=================

This reference manual outlines the current approach to Plone themes. But
you may as well know now that there are other, perhaps simpler,
approaches on the horizon.

Plone theming is getting a bit complicated. So the Plone community, in
its inimitable and energetic way, is already exploring different
solutions to the “theme problem”.

Things move fast. At the time of writing, some of the solutions listed
below are probably not mature enough to use in earnest, particularly if
you are just starting out. However, you might want to investigate them
to see how they’re progressing:

Out of the Box Themes
---------------------

A sprint and ongoing project to generate themes that will ship with
out-of-the box Plone, and to brainstorm on other ways to improve the
Plone theming story

Deliverance
-----------

Deliverance is a lightweight program that applies a theme to content
according to a set of rules.
