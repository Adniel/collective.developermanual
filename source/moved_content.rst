========================================================
 The documentation has been moved to a new location
========================================================

.. image:: /images/moved.jpg

As the annual plone.org clean-up we have moved some old Plone developer manuals to new locations.
This includes

* Old developer manual

* Old theme reference

You can find these manuals on the `developer.plone.org front page <http://developer.plone.org/en/latest/#old-reference-manuals>`_.
Please note that these manuals are for Plone 3 and slowly replaced by new content reflecting the current Plone 4 development best practices.

Unfortunately we cannot give you a direct redirect as there doesn't exist 1:1 mapping
between the old plone.org content and new `developer.plone.org <http://developer.plone.org>`_ content.

For any questions please send email to `plone-docs mailing list <http://plone.org/support/forums/docs>`_.
